Ciprian TEODOROV is a Full Professor at [ENSTA Bretagne](http://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/) and a leading researcher within the [P4S team](https://labsticc.fr/en/teams/p4s) at the [Lab-STICC Laboratory](https://labsticc.fr/en). His main research interests are **executable models, formal verification, model-driven engineering (MDE), and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)**. He leads the [OBP2 *Semantic Diagnosis & Formal Verification*](http://www.obpcdl.org) research team, focusing on bridging theory with practical verification solutions for real-world applications.

Prof. Teodorov critically examines the traditional verification methodologies based on model transformations, which often result in semantic multiplication and the need for complex equivalence proofs. He advocates for *a novel semantic-level approach called [G∀min∃](https://teodorov.github.io/hdr)*, which addresses the challenges of integrating domain-specific executable specification languages with behavior analysis and verification tools. A key innovation in his work is the **G∀min∃ Semantic Language Interface (SLI)**, a modular and reusable architecture that formalizes the dynamic semantics of domain-specific languages, facilitating their seamless integration with behavior analysis tools.

His career reflects a deep commitment to both academic research and industrial innovation.  Prior to his academic tenure, he worked as EDA/CAD Software Engineer at [Dolphin Integration](http://www.dolphin.fr/), Meylan, France, where he played a key role in the development of a modern VHDL language infrastructure. His work contributed to enhancing standard compliance, reducing memory consumption, and improving simulation speed, all of which remain critical challenges in electronic design automation (EDA).

He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Western Brittany](https://www.univ-brest.fr/), France, where he was a member of the “Methods, Tools for Circuits and Systems” (MOCS) team at the [Lab-STICC Laboratory](https://labsticc.fr/en). His doctoral research introduced innovative approaches to physical-design tools for nanoscale computing architectures. During this time, he developed [R2D NASIC](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/NANOARCH.2011.5941486), a nanoscale architectural template built on the NASIC fabric, enabling arbitrary placement and routing at nanoscale. He also created MoNaDe, a model-driven physical-design framework designed to facilitate agile and incremental exploration of the architecture/design-tools adequacy.
