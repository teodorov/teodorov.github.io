## Understanding the Context: Questions That Shape Systems

You have to design a system! Before diving into solutions or creating intricate models, it's essential to ask the right questions during **context analysis**. This phase sets the foundation for effective system design by uncovering the needs, constraints, and interactions within the **problem space**.

Models are powerful tools for making sense of complex systems, but they are only as useful as the questions they help answer. By focusing on the "what," "why," and "who" of context analysis, we pave the way for clarity, alignment, and informed decision-making. This post explores the critical questions every context analysis should address.

**Context analysis** is a mix of **discovery** and **sense-making**. It begins as a diverging phase in the problem space, as illustrated in the double diamond design model, with a focus on broad exploration — uncovering insights, defining boundaries, and identifying opportunities. From there, it transitions into organizing information and aligning perspectives (sense-making), narrowing the focus to set the stage for clearly defining the core problem to address.

## 10 Key Questions To Ask

Technically, context analysis is about defining the system’s boundaries, understanding the external environment (actors, systems, inputs, outputs), and identifying constraints, assumptions, and risks.

A quick list of 10 context analysis questions:

1. What is the **system’s purpose** or mission?

   *What is the primary function or goal of the system within its operational environment?*

2. Who are the external **stakeholders**?

   *Which individuals, groups, or organizations interact with the system?*

3. What are the objectives of the **interactions**?

   *What are the needs of the external entities wrt the mission*
   *What specific needs or goals do external stakeholders seek to fulfil through their interaction with the system?*

4. Why is the system **necessary** in the environment ?
   
   *Evaluates the system's relevance based on stakeholder objectives and broader environmental factors.*
   *Asking this question helps refine the system's purpose by exploring its relevance and value to stakeholders and the environment.*

5. What are the **constraints** imposed by external entities?

   *Are there specific regulations, standards, or expectations from stakeholders that the system must adhere to?*

6. What **assumptions** are made about external actors or systems?

   *Are there assumptions about how external entities (people or systems) will behave or interact with the system?*

7. What are the system **boundaries**?

   - *Where does the system begin and end?*
   - *What functionalities are internal (under your control) versus external (outside of your control - belonging to other entities)?*

8. How might **changes** in **external** conditions affect the system?
   
   Stability & Evolution
   - *What external factors (e.g., market conditions, regulatory changes) could influence the interaction with the system?*
   - *How might the system need to adapt and evolve to shifts in external factors (e.g., technological advancements, shifts in user needs, or emerging regulatory requirements)?*
   
   Perennity & Obsolescence
   - *What will make the problem we are solving obsolete?*
   - Does the problem remains relevant in the future.


   While stability and evolution focus on how the system can adapt to immediate changes in its context, perenity and obsolescence analyze whether those changes might eventually eliminate the problem altogether.

9. What are the **risks** associated with the system’s **external** context?
   
   From the environment to the system (aggressive entities):
      *Are there external threats (e.g., cybersecurity, environmental, supply chain risks) that could affect the system?*
   
   From the system to the environment (sensible entities):
      *Are there unintended ways in which the system can harm its environment (safety, pollution).

10. What are the **societal, ethical, or environmental implications** of the system?

      Systems do not exist in isolation; they influence and are influenced by the societies they operate within. Ignoring societal and ethical impacts can lead to unintended consequences, such as harm to communities, environmental degradation, or public backlash. Addressing these aspects upfront ensures that the system aligns with societal values, builds trust, and adheres to long-term sustainability goals.

Ideally, these questions are addressed in a more structured manner by following a robust context analysis methodology.
